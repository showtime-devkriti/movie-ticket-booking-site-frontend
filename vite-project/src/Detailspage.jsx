                    Kannappa follows Thinnadu, a tribal hunter raised without faith, who discovers a Shiva Lingam in the forest.
                    Guided by instinct, he begins worshipping with raw devotion, eventually offering his own eyes in a supreme act of love and sacrifice.
                    This transforms him into Kannappa, one of Lord Shivaâ€™s greatest devotees.
